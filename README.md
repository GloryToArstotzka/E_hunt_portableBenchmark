portableBenchmark
This is a benchmarking program made just for the game The Equinox Hunt https://theequinoxhunt.com/ https://discord.gg/mUhppdA . IF requested , I can make this work for any other program including Indie Games.  My discord name is the same as the one on github

NOTES FOR USERS:
1. GPU USAGE is not taken just for E_hunt , but for the entire pc , make sure to close all the videos and other games before benchmarking
2. To start a benchmark press P
3. IF you are experiencing crashes , start the program using the batch file "start_pB" and then direct message me the error
